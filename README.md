# SlideRule
Experimenting with how to create a Javascript logarithmic input control.

Temporary implementation here: https://www.engineersneedart.com/ohmslaw/index.html

It's still a work-in-progress but there is enough here someone might want to experiment with it themselves (or give feedback since I am just learning Javascript).
